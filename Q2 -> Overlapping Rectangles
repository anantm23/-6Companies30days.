Approach -> Check wheater one rectangle lies to the left, right, up, down of the other, if not, they intersect.

class Solution:
    
    def doOverlap(self, l1, r1, l2, r2):
        x1,y1=map(int, l1)
        x2,y2=map(int, r1)
        x3,y3=map(int, l2)
        x4,y4=map(int, r2)
        if x2<=x3 or x4<=x1 or y1<=y4 or y3<=y2:
            return int(False)
        return int(True)
