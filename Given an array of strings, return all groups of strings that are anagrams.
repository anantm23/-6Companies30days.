# The approach is to create a dictionary to store all the words having same alphabets in a single list.
# The key to be taken should be consistent, so I am sorting the alphabets and using it as a key to store all its groups.
# The list of all the values in the dictionary will be having all the similar groupings.

            if k in d:
                d[k].append(w)
            else:
                d[k]=[w]
        return d.values()
